            <h3>Barangay Hall</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <p class="description">Barangay Pansol's Barangay Hall was constructed in 1960. However, before it became a Barangay Hall, it was used as an elementary school. The building's previous use as a school suggests that it was likely repurposed as a Barangay Hall after the school was relocated to a new building. Barangay Halls serve as the center of governance for a particular barangay, providing a venue for conducting barangay meetings and hosting various community activities. The fact that the Barangay Hall in Barangay Pansol was originally an elementary school may add to its historical and cultural significance within the community.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p class="description">The Health Care Center in Barangay Pansol was established in September 1960 to provide healthcare services to the residents of the barangay. During that time, it was originally known as Sweepstakes Barrio Community Health Center. Barangays are the smallest administrative divisions in the Philippines, similar to a village or neighborhood. Each barangay has its own elected officials, including a barangay captain who serves as the chief executive of the barangay. Captain Eugenio was the barangay captain of Pansol during the time the Health Care Center was built. Barangay captains are responsible for the overall governance of their respective barangays and are tasked with promoting the general welfare of the barangay's residents. In the case of the Health Care Center, it was likely built as part of Captain Eugenio's efforts to improve the health and well-being of the people in his barangay. Since its establishment in 1960, the Health Care Center in Barangay Pansol has likely undergone many changes and improvements to better serve the health needs of the community.</p>
